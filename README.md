# TamilTB

The static copy in /net/data/TamilTB has not been touched since 2013. It apparently corresponds to the release 0.1. Since then, the Universal Dependencies conversion has been the more visible version of the corpus. However, we should be able to fix errors in the original Prague-style annotation.

Loganathan Ramasamy, the author of the original treebank, is no longer a member of ÃšFAL. This repository has been started by Dan Zeman, based on the release 0.1.
